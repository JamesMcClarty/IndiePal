## What is IndiePal?

IndiePal is a web application that aims to allow users to create, attend, and organize projects to create all types of products. The program is specialized for smaller production, or "independant", groups to arrange their tasks, workforce, and budget to meet their goals.

The users are split into two different accounts: Directors and Talents. Directors are able to do the following:

* Create and edit projects and fill out the title, description, budget, and roles which the talents will fill.
* Hire talents by sending a message to join a particular project's position.
* Dismiss talents that are no longer needed.
* Have two projects open at a time. In order to make more, they must close the permanently. They may also put their project on haitus for a period of time.

Talents fulfill their part by:
* Signing in to showcase their biography, wage for hire, and set of skills.
* Close or reopen their talent accounts.
* Edit their information as they learn and grow.
